      answer: (
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Lineup is your real-time nightlife guide. It helps you discover and decide where to go by showing live data on
          bar crowd levels, line length, music style, cover charge, and distance.
        </p>

      question: "How does the app know what's happening at each bar?",
      answer: (
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Our community of users updates each bar's info live by submitting quick reviews. You help others by
          sharing your experienceâ€”and they help you too.

          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            When you leave a review, it contributes to the overall bar rating using our custom algorithm.

          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            You won&apos;t see your review posted directly, but it still influences the public data.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            If no one has reviewed that bar in the past 24 hours, your review becomes the main one shown until another
            update comes in.
